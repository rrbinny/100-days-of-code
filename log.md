# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I worked on this TypeScript + React Project Course I was doing by Stephen Grider.
I completed the mini-project which was to encompass everything I was learning about TypeScript to the point within the course. TypeScript syntax, Type annotations, Type inference engine, interfaces, Type Definition Files, TypeScript Design Patterns.
Other than that I worked on coding problems on CodeWars.
**Thoughts:**
I feel that I got a lot of through TypeScript with fair ease. Stephen explains stuff really well so I got a grasp of it pretty easily. Plus I've used Java and the similarities are there.
