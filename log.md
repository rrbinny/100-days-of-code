# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I worked on this TypeScript + React Project Course I was doing by Stephen Grider.
I completed the mini-project which was to encompass everything I was learning about TypeScript to the point within the course. TypeScript syntax, Type annotations, Type inference engine, interfaces, Type Definition Files, TypeScript Design Patterns.
Other than that I worked on coding problems on CodeWars.
**Thoughts:**
I feel that I got a lot of through TypeScript with fair ease. Stephen explains stuff really well so I got a grasp of it pretty easily. Plus I've used Java and the similarities are there.

### Day 2: June 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I worked on this TypeScript + React Project Course I was doing by Stephen Grider.
I learnt about using React with TypeScript and the big differences with Type Annotations and interfaces to make sure everything conforms.
I started making progress learning about using Redux with TypeScript.
**Thoughts:**
This was quite a lot for me today if I have to be honest. Even though it was explained well, I need to make sure to look over my notes and the progams to make sure I understand everything.
