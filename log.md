# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I worked on this TypeScript + React Project Course I was doing by Stephen Grider.
I completed the mini-project which was to encompass everything I was learning about TypeScript to the point within the course. TypeScript syntax, Type annotations, Type inference engine, interfaces, Type Definition Files, TypeScript Design Patterns.
Other than that I worked on coding problems on CodeWars.
**Thoughts:**
I feel that I got a lot of through TypeScript with fair ease. Stephen explains stuff really well so I got a grasp of it pretty easily. Plus I've used Java and the similarities are there.

### Day 2: June 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I worked on this TypeScript + React Project Course I was doing by Stephen Grider.
I learnt about using React with TypeScript and the big differences with Type Annotations and interfaces to make sure everything conforms.
I started making progress learning about using Redux with TypeScript.
**Thoughts:**
This was quite a lot for me today if I have to be honest. Even though it was explained well, I need to make sure to look over my notes and the projects to make sure I understand everything.

### Day 3: June 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I worked on this TypeScript + React Project Course I was doing by Stephen Grider.
I completed the Redux with TypeScript mini-app.
**Thoughts:**
Redux with TypeScript is a bit weird. I think one of things that confused me especially was using custom Hooks to make sure to set a type on a specific hook to make sure that the state it accesses is the type of object we define in TS in an interface.

### Day 4: June 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Today I worked on this TypeScript + React Project Course I was doing by Stephen Grider.
I learnt about Webpack bundling and transpiling as well as started the process of introducing ESBuild to the full application.
**Thoughts:**
There was a lot to take in for this, I think I need some time to really read into ESBuild and Webpack and truly understand the concepts
and methods used.

### Day 5: June 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Continued on the Stephen Grider course. Using ESbuild, the application can now transpile and bundle CSS, NPM Modules and JS Code in general. I used caching so that the unpkg(copy of NPM registry) isn't called all the time.
**Thoughts:**
I got a lot done today and I feel I have a deep understanding of ESBuild.

### Day 6: June 27, 2021 (missed two days because I had a lot of stuff going on)

**Today's Progress**:
Continued on the Stephen Grider course. I made some progress handling code execution in the browser.
**Thoughts:**
Working with iFrames to get our code running is a weird rabbit hole but I understand the flow that on how
code will be transpiled and bundle in the browser.
